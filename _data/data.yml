# Profile
profile: |
  I'm a recent Computer Engineering and Informatics graduate with a strong passion for software and front-end development. 
      My academic journey culminated in a thesis titled "Study, analysis, and evaluation of algorithms for extracting community structures in biomedical data," 
      where I delved into algorithms for extracting community structures in biomedical data. 
      The most important thing for me is to gain work experience and to further my knowledge.
       I find particularly interesting Web projects (Web development and design). I am characterized by patience, persistence and team spirit in order to achieve the best possible result.
